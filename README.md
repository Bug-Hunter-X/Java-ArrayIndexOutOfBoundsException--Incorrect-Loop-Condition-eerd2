This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that causes this exception due to an off-by-one error in a `for` loop. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code. This example highlights the importance of careful loop condition handling when working with arrays in Java.
